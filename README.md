# hdr-tonemap
Repo for HDR tonemapping algorithms

There are three video TMOs here.
1. Democratic TMO - taken from https://github.com/hamburgerlady/democratic-tonemap.
2. Real Time TMO - taken from "Kiser, Chris, et al. "Real time automated tone mapping system for HDR video." IEEE International Conference on Image Processing. Vol. 134. Orlando, FL: IEEE, 2012."
3. Script for Hable TMO from ffmpeg. See "http://filmicworlds.com/blog/filmic-tonemapping-operators/"

There also exists support for a native python implementation of Hable, ACES, and Reinhard image TMOs.
